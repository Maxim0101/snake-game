# snake-game

The first time I played the snake game was in Russia.

This project was meant to recreate it with a few extra features but similar nostalgic design.

In this game, you will be able to choose the speed, the size of the screen, and see your high score.

This project uses python, pygame and JSON.

Here is a link to a demonstration video:
